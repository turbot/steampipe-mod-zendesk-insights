# Zendesk Insights Mod for Steampipe

A Zendesk dashboarding tool that can be used to view dashboards and reports across your Zendesk instance.

## Overview

Dashboards can help answer questions like:

- How old are the unresolved tickets?
- Which organizations have opened the most tickets?
- Are users following 2fa best practices?

## Getting started

### Installation

Download and install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install steampipe
```

Install the Zendesk plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

steampipe plugin install zendesk
```
